### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

	Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it was a really fun lab all around. What made it easier was the instructor's comments that guided and helped us figure out what we have to do in order to complete the lab. Something else that makes it more enjoyable was the topic too since it was about pizza. The main factor of it however was my partner, he was incredibly talented in coding and was the main contributor to this project, he would help me in parts where i was confused in and also take on the harder aspects of the labs.

* Lab 5

	Lab 5, part 2 was my favorite of the two because it was the more challenging one. This lab was the first that had me asking for help from outside of the class because I just couldn't understand the instructions, although my attempts ended in failure and my partner was the one to complete the lab and have it fully pass. I did learn from it. The lab was a great challenge but we were able to overcome it and pass the lab.

* Lab 9

	Lab 9 was one of the hardest labs we had in my opinion and that was because of the fact we had to find the average score of an olympic judge. This was hard because at first my partner and I were unsure on what they meant by score and as we searched through google for some sort of answer we were finally ready to attempt it. This lab sure had us confused as to what we had to do but we managed through and found ourselves taking out parts of the lab piece by piece and pretty soon we had a quarter done lab, and then halfway, we decided to continue at home as time was almost up for our class, we then continued from home and finished the lab.
